NodeJs and MongoDB 

Sample using node Js an mongodb with FusionCharts.
Getting Started :
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
Prerequisites
1. Mongodb
2.Node js
3.Express js
3. npm
4. Git shell or composer
5.xampp
Steps :
1. Lets download the node js from following links and install:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Similarly download mongodb and install.
3. Install npm by using the command below.
> npm install <package_name>
A package can be downloaded with the command.
This will create the node_modules directory in your current directory(if one doesn't exist yet), and will download the package to that directory.
4. Create a new directory: $ mkdir node-fusioncharts-demo
Change to the new directory $ cd node-fusioncharts-demo
Install express for specific application using npm by running the command in git shell.
>npm install express
5. Now run the command "mongod"  to run the mongod server.
6. Again run the command "mongo" using git shell to use the database.
7.  Now run your js code using the command node <js_file_name>. 
eg. node server.js
